# Requirements

- Your solution should support from 1 to 5 dice.
- The dice can have from 1 to 100 sides.
- The solution should be able to simulate throwing the dice one or more times, returning the values of the dice.
- The solution needs to store the information about the last 100 throws.
- Document your code (using Python docstrings) and your overall solution (in a README file).
- Provide suggestions about how your solution can be improved.

# Dice Simulator

This project is a simple dice simulator. It supports 1 to 5 dice, each having 1 to 100 sides.

## Features
- Simulate throwing 1 to 5 dice.
- Each dice can have 1 to 100 sides.
- Simulate throwing the dice one or more times, returning the values.
- Stores information about the last 100 throws.
- Saves throw history to a file.

# Weighted Dice Simulator

This project extends the basic dice simulator to support weighted dice. In a weighted dice, certain numbers are more likely to come up than others.

## Features
- Simulate throwing 1 to 5 dice.
- Each die can be weighted differently.
- Simulate throwing the dice one or more times, returning the values.
- Weighted dice: Specify the likelihood of each side of the dice.
- Stores information about the last 100 throws.
- Saves throw history to a file.

## Future Improvements
- GUI for better user interaction.
- More detailed statistics of throws.
